          <hr>
          <p class="banner__content-moto">2.1 Buying, selling and investing in cryptocurrencies can be risky. The risk of loss in trading or holding cryptocurrency can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading or holding cryptocurrency is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. In considering whether to trade or hold cryptocurrency, you should be aware that the price or value of cryptocurrency can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero.</p>
          <p class="banner__content-moto">2.2 The cryptocurrencies market information relating to the past performance of an investment is not necessarily a guide to its performance in the future. The value of investments or income from them may go down as well as up. Like stocks and shares as well, cryptocurrencies are valued from second to second, their bid and offer value fluctuates sometimes widely. The degrees of fluctuation of prices vary significantly and the value of higher volatility funds may change suddenly. The value of investments may rise or fall due to the volatility of world markets, interest rates and capital values or, for investments held in overseas markets, changes in the rate of exchange in the currency in which the investments are denominated. You may not necessarily get back the amount you invested.</p>
          <p class="banner__content-moto">2.3 You know and understand cryptocurrency trading also has certain risks which can cause a complete loss to zero. As cryptocurrencies are no official currency and the legal status is still undefined, their legal nature is subject of change under different jurisdictions. Unlike official currencies, which are backed up by governments or other legal entities like the FED, ECB or others, cryptocurrencies are a private currency, generated by all the world. There is no central bank that could take corrective measures to protect the value of the cryptocurrencies at a possible crisis.

          2.4 You know and understand cryptocurrency trading could be affected by hackers, change of laws, official restrictions, frauds, technical issues, collapse of infrastructure and many other possible threats. </p>

          <p class="banner__content-moto">2.5 All content provided through this website is only for your personal information and use, and is not intended to address your particular requirements or to be relied upon in making (or refraining from making) any specific investment or other decision. Such content shall not constitute any form of advice or recommendation by Bitexmusk. Furthermore, there may be additional risks that Bitexmusk have not foreseen or named in this Terms of Use.

            2.6 Bitexmusk does not provide any investment advice in connection with the services contemplated by these Terms of Use. We only provide information on the price, range, volatility of cryptocurrencies. Any decisions to buy or sell cryptocurrencies are made on your decision solely. Bitexmusk will not be liable for any loss you might face.
            
            2.7 If you are unsure about any specific investment or other decision, you should obtain appropriate expert independent advice and assess carefully whether your financial background is suitable for trading cryptocurrencies. Your decisions and investments are subject to your personal responsibility.</p>

          </h1>
          <hr>
          <p class="banner__content-moto">7.1 External fees. Every cryptocurrency transaction must be added to the blockchain, the official public ledger of all completed transactions, in order to be considered a successful and valid transfer. The work of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain is done by miners, which are powerful computers that make up a portion of the network and confirm its transactions. Miners spend vast amounts of computing power and energy doing this for a financial reward: with every block (a collection of transactions) added to the blockchain comes a bounty called a block reward, as well as all fees sent with the transactions that were confirmed and included in the block. For this reason, miners have a financial incentive to prioritize the validation of transactions that include a higher fee. For someone looking to send funds and get a quick confirmation, the appropriate fee to include depends on the cryptocurrency being sent and can vary greatly, depending on a number of factors, such as transaction size and network conditions. Your wallet will automatically calculate the appropriate fee for sending your chosen cryptocurrency. The fee for sending ether is static (you can view the fee for sending ether by clicking “Send” and selecting Ether as the currency), while the fees for sending bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and stellar are dynamic and will be calculated by your wallet after you input the amount you want to send. This article explains bitcoin transaction fees in greater detail.

          </p>
          <p class="banner__content-moto">7.2 Internal fees. The Our Digital Exchange shall enable matching of buy and sell orders between Users. The latest information on the time for settlement of any transactions and the costs and fees associated with transactions shall be as published on our Site from time to time. According to our rules, for each user there is a mandatory commission for all deposits, and for all withdrawals (1%). We trade at a variable percentage above market rate to cover our operating costs and to allow our vendors to make a profit. The trade-off for this is ease of use and the speed of the service - we're not the cheapest, but we try to be the best! Everything depends on the loading of our system and the magnitude of the operation.

          </p>
          <p class="banner__content-moto">7.3 Collection-Related Costs. If you fail to pay fees or any other amounts owed to Payward under these Terms and Payward refers your account(s) to a third party for collection, then Payward will charge you the lesser of an 12% collection fee or the maximum percentage permitted by applicable law, to cover Payward's collection-related costs. The tax is paid as a separate payment from an external wallet.

          7.4 At the first withdrawal of funds, users must pay a tax of 12% of the amount of your withdrawal. (One-time)
          
          7.5 The tax is paid in a separate transaction from an external wallet by a deposit of the amount of the tax or an amount of more or the equivalent in another coin.</p>

            10.1 When you use your Bitexmusk Account to send or receive cryptocurrency, the transaction must be confirmed and recorded in the public ledger associated with the relevant cryptocurrency network (e.g. the Bitcoin network or the Ethereum network). That cryptocurrency network is solely responsible for verifying and confirming any such transactions. Bitexmusk cannot confirm, cancel or reverse transactions on a cryptocurrency network, other than confirming to you that the network has completed the transaction.
          </p>
          <p class="banner__content-moto">
            10.2 Once submitted to a cryptocurrency network, a transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the network. A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Funds associated with transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your Bitexmusk Wallet balance or be available to you to conduct transactions; When you send cryptocurrency from your Bitexmusk Account, you are authorising us to submit your transaction request to the relevant cryptocurrency network. Once a transaction request has been submitted to the relevant cryptocurrency network, the network will automatically complete or reject the request and neither you or Bitexmusk will be able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. Cryptocurrency networks are operated by decentralised networks of independent third parties. They are not owned, controlled or operated by Bitexmusk so we cannot ensure that any transaction details you submit will be confirmed by the relevant cryptocurrency network. You agree that any transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the cryptocurrency network used to process the transaction.

            10.3 SITE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE THAT: Bitexmusk is not responsible for the operation of any cryptocurrency network’s underlying software protocols and makes no guarantee as to their availability, security, or functionality; the underlying software protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (known as “forks”), and that such forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or name of any cryptocurrency you store in your Bitexmusk Account. Should a fork occur, Bitexmusk may, with or without notice to you, temporarily suspend our operations and, in our sole discretion, decide whether or not to support either branch of the forked protocol entirely; in the event Bitexmusk decides not to support a branch of a forked protocol, you will not be given access to the assets on that fork. Those assets will be securely held by Bitexmusk and we will not buy or sell them.
